# 🐍 First Python Program 🚀

Welcome to my first Python project repository! This project is a collection of Python code snippets demonstrating various functionalities and concepts.

## Technologies Used:
- Numpy 📊: Package for handling multidimensional arrays and matrices.
- Pandas 🐼: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib 📈: Data visualization library.
- Seaborn 🌟: Statistical data visualization.
- Scipy 📊: Library for scientific and technical computing.
- Scikit-learn 🤖: Machine learning library for algorithms.

## Project Structure:
- `First-Python-Program.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code snippets demonstrating Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy, and Scikit-learn functionalities.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Contents:
- **Numpy**: Manipulating arrays, generating arrays, and basic operations.
- **Pandas**: Creating DataFrames, indexing, and basic operations on data.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Data visualization techniques.
- **Scipy**: Statistical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Basic machine learning algorithms and operations.
